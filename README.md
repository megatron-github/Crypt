# Crypt
An introduction to Prolog

A Cryptarithmetic puzzle presents an equation involving nonnegative integers for which letters have been substituted for the digits.

For example <br />
SEND + MORE = MONEY

The goal of the puzzle is to discover the digits for which the letters were substituted. It is further assumed that (1) the digits are unique: no two different letters will be assigned the same digit; and (2) no number in the puzzle has a leading zero. There is one solution to this example puzzle.

SEND + MORE = MONEY <br /> 
9567 + 1085 = 10652
